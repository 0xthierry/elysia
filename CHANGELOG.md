[[Sage]](https://youtu.be/rgM5VGYToQQ) is one of the major experimental releases and breaking changes of KingWorld.

The major improvement of Sage is that it provides almost (if not) full support for TypeScript and type inference.

## Type Inference
KingWorld has a complex type of system. It's built with the DRY principle in mind, to reduce the developer's workload.

That's why KingWorld tries to type everything at its best, inferring type from your code into TypeScript's type.

For example, writing schema with nested `guard` is instructed with type and validation.
This ensures that your type will always be valid no matter what, and inferring type to your IDE automatically.
![FgqOZUYVUAAVv6a](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35027979/200132497-63d68331-cf96-4e12-9f4d-b6a8d142eb69.jpg)

You can even type `response` to make your that you didn't leak any important data by forgetting to update the response when you're doing a migration.

## Validator
KingWorld's validator now replaced `zod`, and `ajv` with `@sinclair/typebox`.

With the new validator, validation is now faster than the previous version by 188x if you're using zod, and 4.1x if you're using ajv adapter.

With Edge Computing in mind, refactoring to new validate dropped the unused packages and reduced size by 181.2KB. 
To give you an idea, KingWorld without a validator is around 10KB (non-gzipped).

Memory usage is also reduced by almost half by changing the validator.
###### According to M1 Max running `example/simple.ts`, running exp.36 uses 24MB of memory while exp.37 use 12MB of memory

This greatly improves the performance of KingWorld in a long run.

## Changelog
Breaking Change:
- Replace `zod`, `zod-to-json-schema`, `ajv`, with `@sinclair/typebox`

Improvement:
- `use` now accept any non `KingWorld<{}, any>`

[Regulus]

This version introduces rework for internal architecture. Refine, and unify the structure of how KingWorld works internally.

Although many refactoring might require, I can assure you that this is for the greater good, as the API refinement lay down a solid structure for the future of KingWorld.

Thanks to API refinement, this version also introduced a lot of new interesting features, and many APIs simplified.

Notable improvements and new features:
- Define Schema, auto-infer type, and validation
- Simplifying Handler's generic
- Unifying Life Cycle into one property
- Custom Error handler, and body-parser
- Before start/stop and clean up effect

    const a = (app: KingWorld) => app
    ```

- Migrate `Header` to `Record<string, unknown>`
    - To migrate:
